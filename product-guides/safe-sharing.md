**Choose who you share with**

Most listings on FOODSHARE receive multiple requests! However it‚Äôs up to you to decide who you want to share with ‚Äì we recommend checking out another user‚Äôs profile (by tapping on their photo), as well as taking into consideration how they messaged you, and the pickup times they can make. Anyone you don‚Äôt want to, or aren‚Äôt able to share with, please make sure to let them know politely that you‚Äôre giving the item(s) to someone else, so you don‚Äôt leave them waiting.

**Check out the item**

People share some awesome stuff on FOODSHARE but make sure to look at the photo and description. Remember that everything on FOODSHARE should be free. Be wary of stock photos of food or non-food items - if something seems too good to be true, it might well be, so please exercise extra caution!

**Check their rating and find out more about them**

You can check out a user's rating on their profile ‚Äì this is displayed once three or more other users give them a rating after sharing an item. Also, check out the ‚ÄòAbout‚Äô section in their user profile to understand more about them, including their likes and dislikes.

As part of the sign-up process, you will be asked to verify your phone number as a safety measure.

**Assess the communication**

Were they friendly and polite in their messaging? Remember that one of our [guidelines](https://app.gitbook.com/o/S1q71czYZ02oMxTaZgTT/s/2G1WDAz6eZVcnkCoxS9s/) is ‚ÄúCourtesy rules"

**Meet in a safe place**

Most of our exchanges happen on the doorstep of the person listing the item(s). However, you can always set the pickup location as a public place if you prefer! If you‚Äôre picking up from another FOODSHAREer, you might want to check out the address and ensure that you‚Äôre comfortable with the area and time of day/night.

You can even leave the item(s) in a safe space outside your house for someone to pick up. This does not apply to Food Waste Hero volunteers.
