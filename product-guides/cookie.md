FOODSHARE CLUB LIMITED UK 14023669 ("Foodshare", "we", "us" or "our") uses cookie technology to offer you a more personalised and better web experience. In this Foodshare Cookie Policy we will provide you with full details of how and for what purposes we use cookies on this website.

Any changes we may make to this Cookie Policy in the future will be listed on this page. Please check regularly to see if this policy has been updated or amended.

**What are cookies and what are they used for?**

A cookie is a small text file which is stored and/or used on the hard drive of your end device (e.g. computer, laptop or smartphone) by your web browser when you visit a website. Almost every website uses cookie technology to make the website work and to optimise design and functionality. Cookies also make your interaction with websites quicker and safer as they can remember your preferences (such as your username and language) by directing the information they contain back to the original website (primary cookie) or to another website to which it belongs (third-party cookie) when you revisit the relevant website using the same end-device. Based on the functions and purposes for which cookies are used, they are generally divided into the following categories of cookies that Foodshare uses on this website:

Strictly necessary cookies allow you to navigate the website and use its basic functions. They are usually set in response to actions you take that express a request for services, such as logging in with your login to the secure area of our website. These cookies are essential for the use of this website.

Functionality cookies are used to recognise you when you return to our website and to provide you with enhanced and more personalised features, such as addressing you by name and remembering your preferences (for example, your choice of region or language). These cookies collect anonymised information and cannot track your movements on other websites.

Analysis and usage cookies allow us to identify and count the number of visitors and collect information about how the website is being used (for example, which pages a visitor visits most often and whether a visitor receives error messages on certain pages). This helps us improve the way our website works, in particular by making it easier for visitors to find what they are looking for.

Marketing and targeting cookies record your visits to our website, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed. We will use this information to show you ads that are more relevant to you and your interests. It is also used to limit the number of times we show you ads and help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. We may also share this information with third parties (such as advertisers) for these purposes.

**Use of third party cookies**

Please note that Foodshare uses third parties to learn about how you use this website in order to optimise your experience as a user and for the purpose of displaying advertisements outside of this website. These third parties (including, for example, advertising networks or external service providers such as web traffic analytics services) may also use cookies to which we have no involvement.
