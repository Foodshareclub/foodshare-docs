**What are your guidelines for sharing?**

**What are your guidelines for sharing?**

ðŸ˜†**Good enough for you.**

Only add food that you would be willing to eat yourself, or non-food items that could be of value to someone else.

ðŸ‘‹**Donâ€™t be shy.**

It doesnâ€™t matter if you only give, only take, or do a little bit of both. It takes two to tango after all.

ðŸ˜‡**Courtesy rules.**

Respect other FOODSHAREers by describing your items accurately, responding promptly to messages and showing up on time.

ðŸ¤”**Best judgment.**

Use it in all interactions with your fellow FOODSHAREers.

ðŸ¤©**Have fun.**

Sharing, and especially food sharing, goes way, way back, yet itâ€™s something of a lost practice. Whether adding or requesting, we encourage you to be bold and experiment!
