### **🛒 Collection bugs** <a href="#_dbl8xsolgxpo" id="_dbl8xsolgxpo"></a>

🐛 BUG: Some users are currently seeing an issue where they are redirected to the join page after successfully signing up as a Food Waste Hero. They are subsequently redirected to [https://foodshare.club/join-volunteer-squad](https://foodshare.club/join-volunteer-squad) when trying to access the volunteer hub, despite now being food waste heroes.

Workaround:

The workaround for this is logging out and logging back in with the same details: if the user does that, it seems to resolve itself. The logout button is located at the top right on the join page.

Extra detail:

We have only been able to replicate this on desktop, and went through the flow usually when testing on iOS.

**🐛 BUG: Tesco collection confirmed, but no food on arrival**

You might receive a confirmation message from Tesco, but arrive at the store and find no food to collect. Tesco have introduced a nationwide ‘automatic estimation’ of food surplus, which gets sent to FOODSHARE, unless there is no food to collect. Due to some technical complications on Tesco’s end, on some occasions, the estimation is incorrect, and by the time you arrive for collection the ‘reduced to clear’ yellow sticker items have been sold to customers.

This issue currently only affects 2.3% of Tesco collections but FOODSHARE knows it’s a massive inconvenience if this is you! We don’t want any FWH to have a wasted journey - ever!

Tesco is working hard with their IT provider to resolve this issue and it’s estimated that accurate estimations will be in place for all stores from October 2021. This is far from perfect and although the technical work is outside FOODSHARE’s control, we are trying to aim is mitigate the effects of these errors as much as humanly possible by:

* Reporting to Tesco HQ all stores that experience issues with this feature. The store managers are then individually contacted and reminded to override the automated donation message, so that you can still take the food home, if there is any.
* Contacting FWHs who have flagged store tech issues via our surveys to reassure them this won’t be held against them and apologise for the wasted journey.

In addition to this, please could you help by:

* Reporting the incident if it happened to you - > tapping ‘Something wrong?’ in the Volunteer Hub
* Speak to store staff about this as they are able to override the system and inform you there is no food

#### **✅ Fix Underway** <a href="#_vrlpq2rzaqhy" id="_vrlpq2rzaqhy"></a>

#### **Remind staff to decline donations each day there is no surplus, or report to FWH team.** <a href="#_t83t3lronfah" id="_t83t3lronfah"></a>

🚫As always, please do not go ahead unless if you have received a confirmation. If you are able to call the store before going ahead please do so for reassurance.

🐛 **BUG**: **Tesco say FOODSHARE haven't accepted.**

You might receive a confirmation message to go ahead, but the manager in store says they haven't received our acceptance messages. If you receive a confirmation, but the store's hand-held PDA device says FOODSHARE hasn't accepted, staff can now run ''Manual Acceptance''. In case they've missed internal communications about this, please ask staff to:

✅ Click _Waiting for Response_

✅ Then _Accept_

✅ Choose _FOODSHARE_

✅ Then _Submit_!

#### **✅ Fixed** <a href="#_b84q6vudx9il" id="_b84q6vudx9il"></a>

Ask staff to use the ''Manual Acceptance''

🐛 **BUG: Tesco** **Conflicting messages**

You might receive conflicting messages from Tesco (i.e confirmation to go followed by a message to say 'no food available') - in this case please go with the most recent (the last) message in the chat.

#### **✅ Fixed** <a href="#_f8l50mcwmsm3" id="_f8l50mcwmsm3"></a>

Follow guidance from most recent Tesco confirmation message[ .](https://help.olioex.com/article/372-reporting-issues)

### **💡 Recently fixed** <a href="#_um7ryyhqxsri" id="_um7ryyhqxsri"></a>

✅ Listings created using Copy and "Make live in" show up in preview with a white wash overlay.

### **3. What should I do if I think I find a bug?** <a href="#_1pzs8elxks3s" id="_1pzs8elxks3s"></a>

Please first check that you have the very latest version of the app! 📱You can do this by visiting the App Store or Google Play. You can also find out what version you're on by tapping the **☰** three horizontal lines at the top of the app and going to the '**Account**' section. Please note: Android releases are available immediately, whereas iOS updates can take several days before they become available.

If this doesn't work, please submit a bug report via the '' **Need more help?**'' button on this page. Please include screenshots where possible.
