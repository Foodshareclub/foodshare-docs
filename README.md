## **Who we are**

Hi, guys! My name is Tarlan Isaev. I have launched a foodshare startup for the global market in January 2020.\
\
The project is still being developed through the efforts of our small team and the additional involvement of experts in the technical part of the implementation, marketing and promotion. After the first milestone, the project was prototyped and feedback was received. We moved on to the second milestone, which is the mobile development and refactoring of the website into an MVP model until November 2021. For this, at this stage we're spending our own resources to develop and design a cross-platform mobile app, using Google's Flutter technology for mobile app development and deployment, in particular the low-code platform FlutterFlow. For design, we use Figma, since they are very popular among designers. Flutter framework itself allows us to write single code for both Android & iOS platforms and covers web and other platforms for workstations.&#x20;

Thus it was decided, in the initial stages of storing information in databases for mobile and web apps, we avoid the costs of virtual services in the cloud, such as Google Firebase assumes a monthly query limit in the form of a free quota. The current WebApp (landing) on FlutterFlow and its databases are hosted on Google's Firebase. It fully covers all our software needs. However, in light of relatevely developments, we are relocated some services to Digitalocean and Oracle cloud servers using. As mentioned above, we are succumbing to various accelerators with opportunities to work out the project on the unit economy, get mentorship, benefit from technical expertise and carefully work out the marketing strategy. At the moment, the cost of the services we spend is quite low - less than $100 a month, mostly for development. We will also involve volunteers who are allowed to keep 20% as an incentive of the food taken out of shops, restaurants before the expiry date of the food. This, the programme should create a unifying mix of heroes. Some of them may work as IT people, lawyers, accountants by day and volunteer food waste rescue heroes by night.
