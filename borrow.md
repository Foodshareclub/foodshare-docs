# Borrow

Borrow is our exciting new feature that helps neighbours lend and borrow everyday household items that they might otherwise buy, store, and let gather dust!

One of the most wasteful things in our society is the fact we have billions of 'things in our local communities that are utilised for just a fraction of their useful lives; meanwhile, our neighbours are busy buying yet more 'stuff'. As we're seeing the climate crisis unfolds it's becoming clear that this endless consumption in a resource-constrained world is taking us perilously close to ecological collapse_._ We know our community has questions such as "Will I get my item back?" or "What happens if my item is damaged", and we've worked hard to address these in the launch version of Borrow (see below). We will continue improving it so that lending and borrowing becomes second nature to us all - much like it always has.

### **General** <a href="#_wnr5o2pamcwa" id="_wnr5o2pamcwa"></a>

* **Does FOODSHARE provide insurance when I lend or borrow items?**
  * No, all items are lent and borrowed at your own risk. Please only lend low value, non-sentimental items. You can request a cash deposit if you would like for peace of mind, and you can restrict who can borrow your items e.g. FOODSHAREers with a 4\*+ rating.
  * We hope to be able to offer insurance within the next 12 months.
* **Can I provide my own insurance?**
  * Please speak with your insurance provider to see if you can personally insure the things you lend on FOODSHARE.
